Welcome!
========

I am **Ibrahim D. Boyenle**, a Ph.D. candidate in Biochemistry at the **University of Maryland**.  
My research focuses on understanding how co-chaperones regulate the conformational cycle of the **Hsp90 molecular chaperone**, combining **experimental biochemistry** with **molecular dynamics simulations**.

I am particularly interested in:
- The structural and functional roles of CS-containing co-chaperones.  
- How co-chaperone interactions modulate Hsp90’s ATPase activity and conformational cycle.  
- Using integrative approaches (biochemical assays, MD simulations, CryoEM, and structural modeling) to uncover mechanisms of chaperone regulation.

### Beyond Research
I enjoy mentoring students, presenting at conferences such as ACS and NOBCChE, and writing about science for both academic and public audiences.  
When I’m not in the lab or running simulations, I’m usually exploring ideas for science communication and international collaboration.
